# SME EU AI Act Readiness Checklist

This checklist is a practical starting point for small organizations. It is not a guarantee of compliance. See [../../docs/DISCLAIMER.md](../../docs/DISCLAIMER.md).

## 1. Basics

- [ ] Named an owner for AI governance (even part-time)
- [ ] Created a central place for AI documentation and evidence
- [ ] Listed approved AI tools and who can approve new ones
- [ ] Defined a minimal "stop / pause" rule for unsafe behavior or unexpected outputs
- [ ] Defined an internal escalation contact for AI questions

## 2. Inventory

- [ ] Created an AI inventory covering:
- [ ] internal tools with AI features
- [ ] customer-facing AI features
- [ ] pilots/experiments that may become production
- [ ] Assigned an owner per AI system/use case
- [ ] Inventory includes vendor/model dependencies and contract references (where available)
- [ ] Inventory links to supporting evidence (vendor docs, decisions, reviews)

Templates:

- [ ] [../templates/ai-system-inventory.csv](../templates/ai-system-inventory.csv)

## 3. Screening and Escalation

- [ ] Completed a basic screening per AI system/use case
- [ ] Defined an escalation path for sensitive/high-impact use cases
- [ ] Paused or limited rollout for flagged high-impact cases until reviewed
- [ ] Documented human oversight and monitoring responsibilities per use case
- [ ] Documented who can override/disable the system if needed

Templates:

- [ ] [../templates/ai-risk-screening-form.md](../templates/ai-risk-screening-form.md)

## 4. Internal Governance

- [ ] Published an internal AI use policy
- [ ] Defined human review requirements for customer-facing outputs
- [ ] Defined incident reporting process
- [ ] Established record keeping locations (inventory, screening notes, vendor responses, incidents)

Templates:

- [ ] [../templates/ai-use-policy-template.md](../templates/ai-use-policy-template.md)
- [ ] [../templates/ai-incident-log.md](../templates/ai-incident-log.md)

## 5. Procurement Controls

- [ ] Added an "AI tool procurement" checklist
- [ ] Collected vendor information for key tools (privacy, security, change management)
- [ ] Verified whether customer inputs are used for training and how to opt out
- [ ] Verified audit logging and export capability (or documented limitations)
- [ ] Verified how major model changes are communicated

Templates:

- [ ] [ai-tool-procurement-checklist.md](ai-tool-procurement-checklist.md)
- [ ] [../templates/vendor-ai-questionnaire.md](../templates/vendor-ai-questionnaire.md)

## 6. AI Literacy

- [ ] Ran basic AI literacy onboarding for users of AI tools
- [ ] Documented training completion
- [ ] Refreshed training after major tool changes

Templates:

- [ ] [../templates/employee-ai-literacy-record.md](../templates/employee-ai-literacy-record.md)

## 7. Monitoring and Incidents (Operational)

- [ ] Defined what you monitor (quality issues, complaints, drift signals) and how often
- [ ] Established an incident log owner and process
- [ ] Logged at least one "tabletop" scenario (practice run) for a plausible incident
