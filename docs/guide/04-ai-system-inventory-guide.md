# AI System Inventory Guide

An inventory is the foundation for everything else: you cannot manage obligations you cannot see.

Use the CSV template for speed:

- [../templates/ai-system-inventory.csv](../../toolkit/templates/ai-system-inventory.csv)

If you prefer a written profile per system, use:

- [../templates/ai-system-inventory.md](../../toolkit/templates/ai-system-inventory.md)

## What Counts as an "AI System" for This Toolkit

For readiness purposes, include anything that:

- makes or supports decisions, recommendations, scoring, ranking, or content generation using AI/ML
- is used in production, pilots, or internal processes
- is customer-facing or impacts real people (customers, employees, applicants, users)

Include third-party tools if your organization relies on their AI features.

## Minimal Fields To Capture

At minimum, record:

- name and owner
- business purpose and where it's used
- your role (provider/deployer)
- vendor/model/provider dependency (if any)
- what data it processes (especially personal data)
- whether it could affect people's rights/safety/access to services
- controls: human oversight, monitoring, and incident reporting

## How To Run the Inventory Process

1. Ask each team: "List the AI tools/features you use or ship."
2. Consolidate and de-duplicate.
3. Assign an owner per inventory row.
4. Add links to evidence (vendor docs, contracts, DPIAs, internal decision notes).
5. Review quarterly and after major releases.
